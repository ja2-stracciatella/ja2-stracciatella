Misan:
- use SDL_Surface instead of FRAME_BUFFER for smacker flicks for blitting

GTr:
- (#41) replace all CASSERT with unit tests
- check VS warnings C4390: ';' : empty controlled statement found; is this the intent?
- replace PODObj.h with one of the standard boost classes

HACK0010
TODO0021

- HACK0007 Stop PreRandom always returning 0 or 1 without ensuring an equal distribution, which would be a rather complex task with pregenerated randoms
- HACK0009 Workaround for trying to play samples with an empty ("") name. Investigate why this happens
- HACK000B Remove unused fields which are only kept for savegame compatibility
- HACK000C Workaround for code trying to access non-existent buttons
- HACK000E uninitialised variables
- HACK000F Investigate whether this workaround, when loading a map containing underflow fillers, is correct
- HACK0010 workaround for maps with overlapping objects: F6, K13, H15 are currently known

- TODO0000 remove RestrictMouseCursor() et al.
- TODO0001 implement blitters and related functions
- TODO0003 Implement sound streaming
- TODO0005 Make it endian agnostic
- TODO0007 Deduct AIM_PENALTY_SMG when firing a SMG even when second hand is free?
- TODO000A Memory leak?
- TODO000B Some values in MovementNoise() can wrap and then produce incorrect results
- TODO000F Only half of the data gets saved/loaded
- TODO0012 Is this fix for the infinite loop when throwing right?
- TODO0013 Code and comment disagree
- TODO0014 Properly resolve the bReverse mess
- TODO0015 Inconsistency between AddStructToTailCommon() and AddStructToHead() regarding return value of FindStructure()
- TODO0018 give quest facts proper names
- TODO0019 remove quirk, which ignores failure to open a file, which happens at the start of the game
- TODO001A investigate, if these ScreenIDs are sensible
- TODO001B OBJECT_NO_OVERWRITE flag handling, when deciding which items an enemy should drop, is strange
- TODO001C Buffer overflow when plotting long (> 256 tiles) paths
- TODO001D When a merc leaves the helicopter, he is placed in the center of the map. But for the first merc (who creates a new squad) PlaceGroupInSector() is called, which moves him to an edge. The later call to SetSoldierExitHelicopterInsertionData() corrects this. Investigate if this can be simplified (maybe removing the PlaceGroupInSector() is possible)
- TODO001E The union in FACETYPE is ugly.
- TODO001F This does not work, when n_slots drops to 0 before all player groups are handled.
- TODO0021 It is crude to ignore FailedToAddNode. If multiple nodes are added, rollback is needed.
