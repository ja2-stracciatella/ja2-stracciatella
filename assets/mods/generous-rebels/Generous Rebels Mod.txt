Generous Rebels mod (GR mod)
--------------------------------------------------


--------------------
| Version
--------------------
GR mod v1.0 - first and probably final release ;)

--------------------
| About
--------------------
This is a mini-mod for Jagged Alliance 2 (JA2). It adds some goodies to the rebel's hideout in Omerta.

--------------------
| Compatibility
--------------------
The GR mod was created for the JA2 Stracciatella ModPack. However, this mod works with just about any version of JA2 including v1.13.
The GR mod should also work with several mods for JA2, as long, as the weapons and maps aren't changed.
Using the GR mod with a mod that changes the weapons or maps will probably lead to weird results.

--------------------
| Some information on the GR mod
--------------------
This mini-mod is intended for players who have a rough time in the beginning of the game. Now, when the player meets the rebels in their underground hideout, they have some nice stuff for him in stock.
Inside the hideout, there is now a suspicious locker (see "GR mod.jpg"). It contains a weapon, add-ons, ammo, armor, a 1st aid kit and night vision goggles, which the player may take.
With these items, the player can take one merc into a tanky sniper.

The gear found here is relatively good, but no "uber"-gear. The merc won't be an invincible super man, but still superior to all early enemy soldiers.
Needles to say, this mod has a NEGATIVE impact on the balance of the early game. This phase of the game will become significantly easier with this mod.

Of course, if you're a battle-hardened veteran of JA2, the GR mod is ABSOLUTELY NOT for you.

--------------------
| Known Bugs & Problems
--------------------
If the player recruits Ira before taking the goodies, she will immediately escort the squad to the surface. The player can still take the goodies - he just has to climb down again.
