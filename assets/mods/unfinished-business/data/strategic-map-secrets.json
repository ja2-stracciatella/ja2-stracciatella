/**
 * Some sectors contain secret facilities or town that are not known at game start. Once they are found, an indicator
 * icon is displayed on the strategic map. Secrets can be found by a quest event, or by visiting the sector.
 *
 * The sector short description (or the "land type string") is changed and a map icon is added when the secret is found.
 *
 * Note that only the first 2 non-SAM secrets are persisted in saves to maintain vanilla save compatability. The base
 * vanilla game has TIXA as the first and ORTA as the second map secret, followed by 4 secret SAM sites.
 *
 * The number of elements and the ordering is important. Changing these may make previous saved games unusable.
 *
 * Fields:
 *   - sector:         The sector where the facility is located. This is used as a key, so one sector can only have at most one secret, so this must be unique within the list
 *   - isSAMSite:      SAM site has different handling on the strategic map, around airspace display modes. Default is false.
 *   - secretMapIcon:  The path to the icon to display on the strategic map, after the secret is found. If skipped, there will be no icon on the map. Not used for SAM sites, as they are handled differently.
 *   - secretLandType: The land type shown in strategic map before the secret is found. See strategic-map-traversibility-ratings for the available types.
 *   - foundLandType:  Land type after the secret is found.
