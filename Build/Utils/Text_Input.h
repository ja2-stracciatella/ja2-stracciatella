//NEW CHANGES:  January 16, 1998
//I have added the ability to stack the text input modes.  So, if you have a particular
//screen that has fields, then somehow, hit a key to go into another mode with text input,
//it will automatically disable the current fields, as you go on to define new ones.  Previously,
//you would have to make sure the mode was removed before initializing a new one.  There were
//potential side effects of crashes, and unpredictable results, as the new fields would cook the
//existing ones.
//NOTE:  You may have to modify you code now, so that you don't accidentally kill a text input mode
//when you don't one to begin with.  (like removing an already deleted button).  Also, remember that
//this works like a stack system and you can't flip through existing defined text input modes at will.

//NOTES ON LIMITATIONS:
//	-max number of fields 255 (per level)
//  -max num of chars in field 255

//The dosfilename inputtype is a perfect example of what is a exclusive handler.
//In this method, the input accepts only alphas and an underscore as the first character,
//then alphanumerics afterwards.  For further support, chances are you'll want to treat it
//as an exclusive handler, and you'll have to process it in the filter input function.

//Simply initiates that you wish to begin inputting text.  This should only apply to screen
//initializations that contain fields that edit text.  It also verifies and clears any existing
//fields.  Your input loop must contain the function HandleTextInput and processed if the gfTextInputMode
//flag is set else process your regular input handler.  Note that this doesn't mean you are necessarily typing,
//just that there are text fields in your screen and may be inactive.  The TAB key cycles through your text fields,
//and special fields can be defined which will call a void functionName( UINT16 usFieldNum )
void InitTextInputMode(void);

//A hybrid version of InitTextInput() which uses a specific scheme.  JA2's editor uses scheme 1, so
//feel free to add new color/font schemes.

//Clears any existing fields, and ends text input mode.
void KillTextInputMode(void);
//Kills all levels of text input modes.  When you init a second consecutive text input mode, without
//first removing them, the existing mode will be preserved.  This function removes all of them in one
//call, though doing so "may" reflect poor coding style, though I haven't thought about any really
//just uses for it :(
void KillAllTextInputModes(void);

//Saves the current text input mode, then removes it and activates the previous text input mode,
//if applicable.  The second function restores the settings.  Doesn't currently support nested
//calls.

//After calling InitTextInputMode, you want to define one or more text input fields.  The order
//of calls to this function dictate the TAB order from traversing from one field to the next.  This
//function adds mouse regions and processes them for you, as well as deleting them when you are done.

//This allows you to insert special processing functions and modes that can't be determined here.  An example
//would be a file dialog where there would be a file list.  This file list would be accessed using the Win95
//convention by pressing TAB.  In there, your key presses would be handled differently and by adding a userinput
//field, you can make this hook into your function to accomplish this.  In a filedialog, alpha characters
//would be used to jump to the file starting with that letter, and setting the field in the text input
//field.  Pressing TAB again would place you back in the text input field.  All of that stuff would be handled
//externally, except for the TAB keys.

void AddUserInputField( INPUT_CALLBACK userFunction );
//INPUT_CALLBACK explanation:
//The function must use this signature:  void FunctionName( UINT8 ubFieldID, BOOLEAN fEntering );
//ubFieldID contains the fieldID of that field
//fEntering is true if you are entering the user field, false if exiting.

//This is a useful call made from an external user input field.  Using the previous file dialog example, this
//call would be made when the user selected a different filename in the list via clicking or scrolling with
//the arrows, or even using alpha chars to jump to the appropriate filename.

//These allow you to customize the general color scheme of your text input boxes.  I am assuming that
//under no circumstances would a user want a different color for each field.  It follows the Win95 convention
//that all text input boxes are exactly the same color scheme.  However, these colors can be set at anytime,
//but will effect all of the colors.

//All CTRL and ALT keys combinations, F1-F12 keys, ENTER and ESC are ignored allowing
//processing to be done with your own input handler.  Otherwise, the keyboard event
//is absorbed by this input handler, if used in the appropriate manner.
//This call must be added at the beginning of your input handler in this format:
//while( DequeueEvent(&Event) )
//{
//	if(	!HandleTextInput( &Event ) && (your conditions...ex:  Event.usEvent == KEY_DOWN ) )
//  {
//		switch( Event.usParam )
//		{
//			//Normal key cases here.
//		}
//	}
//}
//It is only necessary for event loops that contain text input fields.
