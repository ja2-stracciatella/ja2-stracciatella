  title: Tactical Map Item Replacement
  description:
    Mapping of Item ID for pre-placed items on maps. This allows mods to
    replace items with something else, or ignore totally. This does not affect
    items created from other means.

    This is intended for compatibility and for maps that was originally built 
    for different item sets (e.g. Wildfire maps).

    Items are identified by either item index (if given integer), or internal 
    name (if given string). Items mapped to 0 ("Nothing") are removed from map 
    placements.
