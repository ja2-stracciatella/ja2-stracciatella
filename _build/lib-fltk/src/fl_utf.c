    If \p p points at an illegal UTF-8 encoding, including one that
    would go past \e end, or where a code is uses more bytes than
    necessary, then *(unsigned char*)p is translated as though it is

    Treating errors this way allows this to decode almost any

    UTF-8 is expected, and has proven very useful.

    If you want errors to be converted to error characters (as the
    standards recommend), adding a test to see if the length is
    unexpectedly 1 will work:

    \code
    if (*p & 0x80) {              // what should be a multibyte encoding

    speed up the scanning of strings where the majority of characters

  UTF-16.

  \p src points at the UTF-8, and \p srclen is the number of bytes to

  Notice that sizeof(wchar_t) is 2 on Windows and is 4 on Linux
  and most other systems. Where wchar_t is 16 bits, Unicode
  characters in the range 0x10000 to 0x10ffff are converted to

    (especially on Windows) into UTF-8.

    Up to \p dstlen bytes are written to \p dst, including a null
    terminator. The return value is the number of bytes that would be
    written, not counting the null terminator. If greater or equal to
    \p dstlen then if you malloc a new array of size n+1 you will have
    the space needed for the entire string. If \p dstlen is zero then
    nothing is written and this call just measures the storage space
    needed.

    \p srclen is the number of words in \p src to convert. On Windows
    this is not necessarily the number of characters, due to there
    possibly being "surrogate pairs" in the UTF-16 encoding used.
    On Unix wchar_t is 32 bits and each location is a character.

    On Unix if a \p src word is greater than 0x10ffff then this is an
    illegal character according to RFC 3629. These are converted as
    though they are 0xFFFD (REPLACEMENT CHARACTER). Characters in the
    range 0xd800 to 0xdfff, or ending with 0xfffe or 0xffff are also
    illegal according to RFC 3629. However I encode these as though
    they are legal, so that fl_utf8towc will return the original data.

    On Windows "surrogate pairs" are converted to a single character
    and UTF-8 encoded (as 4 bytes). Mismatched halves of surrogate
    pairs are converted as though they are individual characters.
