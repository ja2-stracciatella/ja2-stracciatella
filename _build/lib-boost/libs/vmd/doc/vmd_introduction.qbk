[section:vmd_intro Introduction]

Welcome to version 1.9 of the Variadic Macro Data library.

The Variadic Macro Data library, referred to hereafter as VMD for 
short, is a library of variadic macros which provide enhancements 
to the functionality in the Boost preprocessor library ( Boost PP ),
especially as it relates to preprocessor "data types".

The functionality of the library may be summed up as:

# Provide a better way of testing for and using empty parameters and empty preprocessor data.
# Provide ways for testing/parsing for identifiers, numbers, types, tuples, arrays, lists, and seqs.
# Provide ways for testing/parsing sequences of identifiers, numbers, types, tuples, arrays, lists. and seqs.
# Provide some useful variadic macros not in Boost PP.
   
The library is a header only library and all macros in the 
library are included by a single header, whose name is 'vmd.hpp'.
Individual headers may be used for different functionality 
in the library and will be denoted when that functionality is
explained.

All the macros in the library begin with the sequence 'BOOST_VMD_'
to distinguish them from other macros the end-user might use. Therefore
the end-user should not use any C++ identifiers, whether in macros or
otherwise, which being with the sequence 'BOOST_VMD_'.

Use of the library is only dependent on Boost PP. The library also 
uses Boost detail lightweight_test.hpp for its own tests.
