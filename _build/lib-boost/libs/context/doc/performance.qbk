[section:performance Performance]

Performance of __boost_context__ was measured on the platforms shown in the
following table. Performance measurements were taken using `rdtsc` and
`boost::chrono::high_resolution_clock`, with
overhead corrections, on x86 platforms. In each case, cache warm-up was
accounted for, and the one running thread was pinned
to a single CPU. The code was compiled using the build options,
'variant = release cxxflags = -DBOOST_DISABLE_ASSERTS'.
