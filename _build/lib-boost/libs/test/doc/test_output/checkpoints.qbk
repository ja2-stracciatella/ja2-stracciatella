[section:checkpoints Checkpoints]

Checkpoints may be used to indicate the state of the running test with more granularity in case a fatal 
error occurs during the test. The checkpoints are also convenient for checks in loops as they might provide
more information about the occurrence of a failure.

[h3 Named checkpoints]


The macro __BOOST_TEST_CHECKPOINT__ is intended to be used to inject [*named] checkpoint position. The
macro signature is as follows:

``
  __BOOST_TEST_CHECKPOINT__(checkpoint_message);
``

The message formatted at the checkpoint position is saved and reported by the exception logging functions (if any
occurs). Similarly to the __BOOST_TEST_MESSAGE__ the message can be formatted from any standard
output stream compliant components.

[h3 Unnamed checkpoints]

The macro __BOOST_TEST_PASSPOINT__ is intended to be used to inject an [*unnamed] checkpoint position. The
macro signature is as follows:

``
  __BOOST_TEST_PASSPOINT__();
``

Unlike the macro __BOOST_TEST_CHECKPOINT__ this macro doesn't require any message to be
supplied with it. It's just a simple "been there" marker that records file name and line number
code passes through.
