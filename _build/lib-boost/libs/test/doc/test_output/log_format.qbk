[section Log formats]
[section:log_human_readable_format Human readable log format]

The human readable log format is designed to closely match an errors description produced by the Microsoft family
of C++ compilers. This format allows jumping to the error location, if test module output is redirected into IDE
output window. The rest of the log messages are designed to produce the most human friendly description of the
events occurring in test module. This is a default format generated by test modules.

Here the list of events along with corresponding message and the condition that has to be satisfied for it to appear
in the output.

  [ [On skipped test unit]

  [ [On fatal system error]
    [threshold <= log_fatal_errors. Checkpoint message is reported only if provided]

  [ [On passed test assertion]

  [ [On failed WARNING level test assertion]
    [threshold <= log_warnings]

  [ [On failed CHECK level test assertion]
    [threshold <= log_all_errors]

  [ [On failed REQUIRE level test assertion]
    [threshold <= log_fatal_errors]
    [`<assertion location>: fatal error in <test case name>: critical check <assertion description> failed`]]

  [ [On test log message]
    [threshold <= log_messages]
    [`<Message content>`]]
]

Advanced [link boost_test.testing_tools testing tools] may produce more detailed error messages.

[section:log_xml_format XML based log output format]

This log format is designed for automated test results processing. The test log output XML schema depends on the
active log level threshold.
