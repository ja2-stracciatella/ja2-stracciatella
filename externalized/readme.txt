Settings in game.json
=====================

  ms_per_game_cycle

        Number of milliseconds for one game cycle.
        25 ms gives approx. 40 cycles per second (and 40 frames per second, since the screen
        is updated on every cycle).

        Decrising this value will increase speed of the game (enemy movement, bullets speed, etc).

  tactical_hotkey_j

        Enables 'j' hotkey for climbing up/down.
