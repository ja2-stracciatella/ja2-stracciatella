/*
Kris -- Notes on how the undo code works:

At the bottom of the hierarchy, we need to determine the state of the undo command.  The idea
is that we want to separate undo commands by separating them by new mouse clicks.  By holding a mouse
down and painting various objects in the world would all constitute a single undo command.  As soon as
the mouse is release, then a new undo command is setup.  So, to automate this, there is a call every
frame to DetermineUndoState().

At the next level, there is a binary tree that keeps track of what map indices have been backup up in
the current undo command.  The whole reason to maintain this list, is to avoid multiple map elements of
the same map index from being saved.  In the outer code, everytime something is changed, a call to
AddToUndoList() is called, so there are many cases (especially with building/terrain smoothing) that the
same mapindex is added to the undo list.  This is also completely transparent, and doesn't need to be
maintained.

In the outer code, there are several calls to AddToUndoList( iMapIndex ).  This function basically looks
in the binary tree for an existing entry, and if there isn't, then the entire mapelement is saved (with
the exception of the merc level ).  Lights are also supported, but there is a totally different methodology
for accomplishing this.  The equivalent function is AddLightToUndoList( iMapIndex ).  In this case, only the
light is saved, along with internal maintanance of several flags.

The actual mapelement copy code, is very complex.  The mapelement is copied in parallel with a new one which
has to allocate several nodes of several types because a mapelement contains over a dozen separate lists, and
all of them need to be saved.  The structure information of certain mapelements may be multitiled and must
also save the affected gridno's as well.  This is also done internally.  Basically, your call to
AddToUndoList() for any particular gridno, may actually save several entries (like for a car which could be 6+
tiles)

MERCS
Mercs are not supported in the undo code.  Because they are so dynamic, and stats could change, they could
move, etc., it doesn't need to be in the undo code.  The editor has its own way of dealing with mercs which
doesn't use the undo methodology.
