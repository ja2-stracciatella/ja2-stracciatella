//These following functions are currently used exclusively by the editor.
//Now, this will be useful for the strategic AI.
//Definitions:
//Soldier (s):	Currently in the game, but subject to modifications.  The editor has the capability to
//  modify soldier attributes on the fly for testing purposes.
//BasicPlacement (bp):  A BASIC_SOLDIERCREATE_STRUCT that contains compact, very general, information about
//  a soldier.  The BasicPlacement is then used to generate a DetailedPlacement before creating a soldier.
//  Most of the soldiers saved in the maps will be saved in this manner.
//DetailedPlacement (pp):  A SOLDIERCREATE_STRUCT ready to be passed to TacticalCreateSoldier to generate
//  and add a new soldier to the world.  The DetailedPlacement contains all of the necessary information
//  to do this.  This information won't be saved in maps. In most cases, only very few attributes are static,
//  and the rest are generated at runtime.  Because of this situation, saved detailed placements must be in a
//  different format.
//StaticDetailedPlacement (spp):  A hybrid version of the DetailedPlacement.  This is the information saved in
//  the map via the editor.  When loaded, this information is converted to a normal detailed placement, but
//  must also use the BasicPlacement information to complete this properly.  Once the conversion is complete,
//  the static information is lost.  This gives us complete flexibility.  The basic placements contain relative
//  values that work in conjunction with the strategic AI's relative values to generate soldiers.  In no
//  circumstances will static detailed placements be used outside of the editor.  Note, that this hybrid version
//  uses the identical structure as detailed placements.  All non-static values are set to -1.

//Used to generate a detailed placement from a basic placement.  This assumes that the detailed placement
//doesn't exist, meaning there are no static attributes.  This is called when you wish to convert a basic
//placement into a detailed placement just before creating a soldier.
void CreateDetailedPlacementGivenBasicPlacementInfo( SOLDIERCREATE_STRUCT *pp, BASIC_SOLDIERCREATE_STRUCT *bp );

//are defaulted to -1.  When an attribute is made to be static, that value in replaced by the new static value.
//This information is NOT compatible with TacticalCreateSoldier.  Before doing so, you must first convert the
//static detailed placement to a regular detailed placement.
