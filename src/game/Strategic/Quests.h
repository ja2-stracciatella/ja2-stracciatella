// The first quest is mandatory. Player must find Miguel and deliver letter to him. The tough
// part is finding him. Miguel is UNDERGROUND in EAST OMERTA. Only by talking to Miguel's right
// hand man will the player be delivered to this hideout. This hideout will also serve as the
// player's HQ and inventory stash.
#define QUEST_DELIVER_LETTER		0


// This quest is triggered by Miguel. Player can liberate route from either SAN MONA or
// Drassen. Result allows player to hire on 2 of Miguel's guys.
#define QUEST_FOOD_ROUTE				1

// terrorist quests: 3 out of possible 6 per game - randomized which 3 and where. The
// Bounty Hunter will either appear in CAMBRIA or ALMA. He'll give a diskette with files
// on three of these terrorists. (we won't give files for all six since it may confuse
// player if ony 3 of them exist). The files will contain photographs. The terrorists will go
// by aliases and the photographs will be hard to tell if the NPC is really a terrorist.
// Bounty Hunter will give reward ($$$ CASH $$$) for proof of each death.

// While there'll always be one arms dealer in SAN MONA, there'll be a second one
// randomized in the outskirts of either: GRUMM, BARLINETTA or ESTONI. Only way player
// will know where to look will be to talk to certain town residents.

// A hermit will exist in each game, but in a different location. The player can try to
// talk to him, but he won't admit much. If the player threatens him, he gets his pet blood
// cats to attack the player. However, if the player talks to the hermit's brother, the brother
// will give valuable info (a code phrase) to the player that will allow the hermit to talk
// to the player, telling him about using creature blood when in the mines and giving him a
// vile - good enough for 3 mercs.
#define QUEST_FIND_HERMIT				10


// SAN MONA is a tough town. Player will find it tough to get any info out of any residents
// because they won't trust the player's mercs. SAN MONA doesn't have it as tough as any of
// the other towns - the local authorities (Queen's police) is as corrupt as the residents
// and to protect themselves they don't deal with outsiders. All residents will more or less
// let the player know that unless the word comes down from the top dude, no one will speak
// or deal with them. So, the player must seek out the top dude who'll want the player to
// fight his strongest bodyguard (hand to hand or knife).

// Arulco farmer in F11 (Juan Erizia) is suspected of harboring a weapons cache in support
// of the Queen's forces. Player finds out about him in Cambria via conversation with a non
// family member (many of Cambria's residents are related/Erizias). So, player can go
// investigate. F11 must be liberated and Juan Erizia must still be alive. We randomize
// between QUEST_WEAPON_FARM and QUEST_SICK_WIFE. Player goes to talk to Juan. If he arrives
// during nighttime, there won't be too many cousins hanging around, but player has to be
// careful
//any attempt to
// investigate will awaken everyone, a battle will ensue.


// Player finds out through conversation in Cambria that Juan suspected of harboring weapons
// cache.

// Juan is very protective of his farm.
// Juan has 3 sons, 4 nephews and a sick wife.
// Juan refuses attempts to inspect his farm unless his brother has arranged it.
// Brother Emile is in Cambria.
// Player can investigate at night as long as he doesn't wake anyone.
// If player has talked to Emile, Juan will give him permission to investigate everywhere
// except his bedroom (citing a sick wife).

// his home in Balime. Returning the treasure to Chitzena boosts loyalty points.
#define QUEST_RUIN_ARTIFACT			19


// In Cambria, there is a serial killer on the loose, attacking miners. This will only
// start to happen once player has control over the city & mine. It affects the number
// of residents willing to work in the mines (loyalty basically).
