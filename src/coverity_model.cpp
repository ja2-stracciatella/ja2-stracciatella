//! This file is used to avoid false positives.
//! When changed, it must be uploaded manually in the "Analysis Settings" tab.
//!
//! The following considerations should be kept in mind:
//!  * headers cannot be imported
//!  * builtin types like int/char/void are available, but not wchar_t/NULL/...
//!  * full structs and typedefs are not needed, rudimentary structs and similar types are sufficient
//!  * an uninitialized local pointer means the variable can be null or have some data
//!
