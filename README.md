This is continuation of venerable JA2-Stracciatella project.

The goal of the project was to make Jagged Alliance 2 available on a wide range of platforms, improve its stability, fix bugs and provide a stable platform for mod development.  At the moment the goal mostly to fix bugs.

Official Homepage: http://ja2-stracciatella.github.io/

To get in touch with the developers you can use the [#ja2-stracciatella IRC channel on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ja2-stracciatella).

## How to start the game

1. Install original Jagged Alliance 2 game on your computer.  Data files from the original game will be used by JA2-Stracciatella

2. [Download JA2-Stracciatella](http://ja2-stracciatella.github.io/download/) or [compile](COMPILATION.md) it from the cloned git repository.

### With the optional launcher
3. Start the launcher and use it to configure the game. It will automatically create the configuration file.

4. Set “JA2 Data Directory” to point to the directory where the original game was installed during step 1. You can manually enter the directory or use the “...” button to browse your computer.

5. If you haven't installed the English version of the original game, you have to select the correct “Game Version” i.e. localization. Note that the game supports two different Russian localizations: RUSSIAN for the “BUKA Agonia Vlasty” release and RUSSIAN_GOLD for the “Gold” release.

### Without the optional launcher
3. Start the game the first time.  It will create the configuration file %USERPROFILE%\Documents\JA2\ja2.json on Windows or ~/.ja2/ja2.json on Unix-like systems.

4. Edit the configuration file and set parameter game_dir to point to the directory where the original game was installed during step 1.  For example, D:\games\ja2\ (on Windows) or /home/user/games/ja2-installed (on Linux).

5. If you installed not English version of the original game, but one of the localized varieties (e.g. French or Russian), you need to start ja2.exe with parameter telling which version of the game you are using.  For example: ```ja2.exe -resversion FRENCH```

Supported localizations are DUTCH, ENGLISH, FRENCH, GERMAN, ITALIAN, POLISH, RUSSIAN, RUSSIAN_GOLD. Use RUSSIAN for the “BUKA Agonia Vlasty” release and RUSSIAN_GOLD for the “Gold” release.

If you downloaded a precompiled version of JA2-Stracciatella, the archive may contain a set of bat files for all supported localizations.

Run ```ja2.exe -help``` for list of available options.


## Development

The project is developed on [github](https://github.com/ja2-stracciatella/ja2-stracciatella).  Pull requests with bug fixes are very welcome.

### How to contribute

The best way to contribute is to make a pull request with a bug fix.  Please see list of open issues [here](https://github.com/ja2-stracciatella/ja2-stracciatella/issues).

The second best way is to file a bug report if you encounter a bug.

### How to make a pull request

1. Fork the project
2. Create a branch (git checkout -b my_feature_branch)
3. Commit your changes (git commit -am "description of your changes")
4. Push to the branch (git push origin my_feature_branch)
5. Create a pull requst from your branch into master

Please don't reformat the code for the sake of it, because it will make the merge process harder.  Instead use the following settings in your editor:
- display tab as 8 spaces
- indent with tabs
If you add new code, please don't add spaces after opening or before closing round brackets.

## History of the Project

The original project was run by Tron since 2006.  He did an amazing job of
cleaning up JA2 sources and making them portable.  The work was massive too -
there are over *7000 commits* in the original svn repository
svn://tron.homeunix.org/ja2/trunk.  Unfortunately, the work on the project
ceased in 2010.  The [original project homepage](http://tron.homeunix.org/ja2)
is no longer available.  Some history can be found in [JA2-Stracciatella
Q&A](http://thepit.ja-galaxy-forum.com/index.php?t=msg&th=13222)
